# PiCon.app
- _'Appified'_ container for running a Linux VM in macOS with no additional software (Docker, VMware Fusion, VirtualBox, etc...) required.
- Deploys a standard Deban 12 cloud image and installs Pi-hole with minimal user input.

## Info
 - Works on any 2010 or newer Mac.  QEMU / Lima binaries included are Intel and Apple Silicon native.
 - Requires macOS 10.13 or newer, bridged networking requires macOS 10.15 or newer
 - Container uses **1/16th** of the host Mac's RAM, up to 1GB. For example, a Mac with 4GB RAM will create a 256MB container capable of serving DNS on a typical home network.
 - Pi-hole instance is persistent across reboots and starts in the background as a system-level launch daemon.  
 - An embedded version of [PiBar](https://github.com/amiantos/pibar) is configured during installation and starts at login.
   
## Install
 - [Download](https://github.com/DesktopECHO/PiCon/releases/latest) the latest release of PiCon.app and move it to your `/Applications` folder (Note that moving the app to this location is _mandatory_)
